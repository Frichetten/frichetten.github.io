        <h1>RedBirdHacks Big Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>The following are the results of my data analysis project at RedBirdHacks 2016. I will post my results as the event
        goes on. All code and data can be found <a href="https://github.com/Frichetten/RedBirdHacks2016BigData">here</a></p>
        <p>For a data set to be considered a part of big data, it commonly must have some or all of the 4 v's.
        These are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. For my project, I chose the data set of all traffic accidents in
        the state of Maryland for 2015(available <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/maryland-statewide-vehicle-crashes-cy2015-quarter-1">here</a>)
        This data set includes a ton of information on every traffic accident in the state of Maryland during 2015. The goal is to
        identify, model, and comment on trends present in the data, such as the number of DUI related traffic accidents,
        rate of traffic accidents during poor weather, and other factors.</p>
        
        <p>This data set was released by the government of the state of Maryland on February 11th 2016 and satisfies
        several of the 4 v's of big data. With almost 19,340,987 points of data to consider, this data definitely falls
        into the high volume category. The data also contains a high amount of variety which satisfies the second v.
        The third v is veracity which is the trustworthiness of the data, and considering that this data was published by the 
        government, I believe it to be accurate. The final v is velocity and our data does not satisfy this principal
        because no new data is being analyzed, however 3/4 is certainly sufficient to declare this data set as being
        a part of big data.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the event I will be updating this page with my findings. </p>
        
        <h3>6:10PM > Number of Accidents Per Quarter</h3>
        <p>Below is the first chart made of the event. The number of accidents per quarter. There is a noticeable trend 
        that accidents happen more in quarter 4. Could this be due to bad weather? Lets find out!</p>

        <h3>6:53PM > Number of Accidents Based On Gender</h3>
        <p>It looks like men are much riskier </p>
