        <h1>RedBirdHacks Big Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>The following are the results of my data analysis project at RedBirdHacks 2016. I will post my results as the event
        goes on. All code and data can be found <a href="https://github.com/Frichetten/RedBirdHacks2016BigData">here</a></p>
        <p>For a data set to be considered a part of big data, it commonly must have some or all of the 4 v's.
        These are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. For my project, I chose the data set of all traffic accidents in
        the state of Maryland for 2015(available <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/maryland-statewide-vehicle-crashes-cy2015-quarter-1">here</a>)
        This data set includes a ton of information on every traffic accident in the state of Maryland during 2015. The goal is to
        identify, model, and comment on trends present in the data, such as the number of DUI related traffic accidents,
        rate of traffic accidents during poor weather, and other factors.</p>
        
        <p>This data set was released by the government of the state of Maryland on February 11th 2016 and satisfies
        several of the 4 v's of big data. With almost 19,340,987 points of data to consider, this data definitely falls
        into the high volume category. The data also contains a high amount of variety which satisfies the second v.
        The third v is veracity which is the trustworthiness of the data, and considering that this data was published by the 
        government, I believe it to be accurate. The final v is velocity and our data does not satisfy this principal
        because no new data is being analyzed, however 3/4 is certainly sufficient to declare this data set as being
        a part of big data.</p>
        
        <h3>Lookup Script</h3>
        <p>While writing Python code to examine data is effective and quick, there were plenty of times where I wanted to see
        the full picture behind an accident. Who was involved? What types of cars were there? Was there are fatality? To help
        answer these questions I built Lookup.py; a tool to help me see all the pertinent information in any particular crash.
        Simply punch in a report number, and see everything that happened. This tool proved invaluable when examine data by
        hand</p>

        <h3>Number of Accidents Per Quarter</h3>
        <p>Accidents increase during the year with a peak in Q4. Based on my analysis, the reason for this is that Q4 has the
        highest number of complications, including, holidays which promote travel and drinking, and winter weather which 
        increases number of crashes. In total there were 110,737 accidents in 2015. This conclusion is supported by
        data from <a href="http://www.mva.maryland.gov/safety/stats/stats.htm">mva.maryland.gov</a> which says that total 
        number of crashes should be in this range.</p>

        <h3>Number of Accidents by Gender</h3>
        <p>Men are almost a third more likely to be in an accident as a driver compared to women. This conclusion is supported
        by data from <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/men-vs-women-who-are-safer-drivers/">CBS</a> who mention that men are
        more likely to drive recklessly, and more likely to drive drunk. This reckless behavior translates into money because
        men statistically pay higher car insurance rates(<a href="http://www.autoinsurance.org/why-do-men-pay-more-than-women-on-auto-insurance/">source</a>).</p>

        <h3>Traffic Collision Fatalities By Gender</h3>
        <p>Likely due to their reckless driving, men are more likely to die in a traffic collision. By my analysis, men make up
        almost 70% of all fatalities in crashes. This conclusion is supported by the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/gender">iihs</a>
        who claim that "Males accounted for 71 percent of passenger vehicle driver deaths".</p>

        <h3>Number of Traffic Fatalities</h3>
        <p>By my analysis, there were 472 fatalities in 2015. This conclusion is supported by the <a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd-30/ncsa/STSI/24_MD/2014/24_MD_2014.htm">NHTSA</a>
        which indicates that this number of fatalities is consistent with past values.</p>
        
        <h3>9:04PM > Number of DUI/DWI Related Accidents</h3>
        <p>A common piece of advice to give to new drivers is to be wary of driving on holidays because there may be more
        drunk drivers on the road. I'm going to put this to the test, by identifying the number of DUI's and DWI's per
        quarter. There is clearly more during Q4, which is during the majority of the year's holidays. Next plan of action,
        break the data down by month and day and see if there are more accidents caused by DUI/DWI on holidays. Important
        to note, I am including drug related crashes as well, as they fall under DUI's.</p>

        <h3>11:57PM > DUI/DWI Data Inconclusive</h3>
        <p>While I did notice that the number of DUI/DWI crashes did increase on holidays, specifically New Years Day
        and Halloween, however there appeared to be arbitrarily high numbers of crashes on random days. For example
        there were 44 crashes on december fifth. I considered that there was some sort of event like a party or concert
        that would cause more people to drive under the influence, however when I checked what counties these crashes
        occured in, I didn't find a particular area in which there was a heavy or abnormal concentration. However, I did notice 
        the days with the most DUI/DWI crashes occured on the weekends, leading to believe that my search was in the
        right direction. For now I will suspend looking into DUI/DWI crashes.</p>
        
        <h3>12:48AM > Traffic Accident Fatalities Consistent With Recorded Data</h3>
        <p>Good news. My results indicate that there were 518 traffic collision fatalities in 2015. This is consistent with
        other groups analysis! <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/traffic-deaths-hit-record-low-last-year-but-2015-trend-is-alarming/2015/11/24/f95ca598-92b5-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html"
        >This</a> article indicates that there would be an increase in the number of traffic colision fatalities in 2015,
        meaning that my analysis is correct.</p>
        
        <h3>2:45AM > Car Models Most Involved In Accidents</h3>
        <p>I ran a script to find the car models that are involved in the most accidents. The winners are not that surprising
        considering that they are some of the most common cars on the market. However, these are the cars that the data indicates
        are involed in the most crashes.</p>

        <h3>12:52PM > Number of Accidents Attributed to Age Ranges Per 100 People</h3>
        <p>The old addage that young people get in more car accidents is correct. The age range of 15-24 leads with number
        of accidents attributed to them per 1000 people, with over 29 per 1000. However, they are followed closely by
        the 25-34 demographic. My data also indicates that older people start picking up the trend of more accidents again</p>

        <h3>4:23PM > Major Causes of Accidents</h3>
        <p>Based on my research there are several major causes of accidents. The major one being that people just don't pay
        attention. The next biggest reason of crashes is due to speeding, following by failing to yield to the right of 
        way and following too closely. Surprisingly, falling asleep at the wheel is a major cause of accidents. In fact
        its one of the biggest causes.</p>

        <h3>6:04PM > Causes of Fatal Accidents</h3>
        <p>My results match up with the results of other organizations yet <a href="http://www.drivers.com/article/1173/">again</a>.
        Based on the percentages of reasons for accients, failing to pay attention is the number one cause of traffic fatalities.
        It is important to note that failing to pay attention is a broad term that covers many different things including distraction,
        texting, talking, eating, etc. The second greatest cause of fatalities is speeding followed by alcohol</p>
