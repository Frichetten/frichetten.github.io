# frichetten.github.io - My Personal Website 3.0

Since 2015 I've been using GitHub Pages to host my website. It's an incredible platform, 
and one I would happily recommend to anyone interested in a free and easy web hosting platform.

There is a downside though. Well, there are a few of them. Here is a small list:

* No HTTPS support for custom domains
* Can't do anything beyond basic HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript
  (Not GitHub's fault, but any developer would want more right?)
* No access to web traffic information

To fix this I have rebuilt my website in full MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). It is currently hosted on Digital Ocean and uses Nginx as the reverse proxy.
