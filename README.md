# frichetten.github.io - My Personal Website 3.0

Since 2015 I've been using GitHub Pages to host my website. It's an incredible platform, 
and one I would happily recommend to anyone interested in a free and easy web hosting platform.

There is a downside though. Well, there are a few of them. Here is a small list:

* No HTTPS support for custom domains
* Can't do anything beyond basic HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript
  (Not GitHub's fault, but any developer would want more right?)
* No access to web traffic information

There are more that other developers have been quick to point out, but these are the key ones for me.

I plan to re-imagine my website in a full MEAN stack and host it using Digital Ocean. I will opensource 
it so that others can learn from what I make.
