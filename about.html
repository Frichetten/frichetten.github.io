		<h2>Work Experience (Reverse Chronological Order)</h2>
		<h3>State Farm: Information Security Analyst - Co-op</h3>
		<p>At the end of my internship with State Farm I was evaluated based on my skills, work quality, 
		and potential. I recieved a superb evaluation (the highest possible), and thus I was asked to 
		stay on during the school year as a co-op. I work part time with the same team I worked with during 
		the summer; Vulnerability Assessment and Management Team. This is State Farm's penetration testing 
		group. Here I perform a wide array of responsibilities, from research, to application development, 
		to assisting with pen testing. Working with the pen test team is an incredible experience because 
		I get to understand how a professional would compromise a system. In addition I have assisted with 
		red team activity at State Farm, constantly challenging the status quo, and understanding how we can 
		improve the security posture of the organization.</p>
		
		<h3>State Farm: Intern</h3>
		<p>I was very lucky to participate in State Farm's summer internship program. I was assigned to work 
		with the Vulnerability Assessment and Management team; also known as the penetration testing team. 
		Here I performed a variety of tasks, from software development, security policy drafting, and assisting 
		with penetration testing. In addition, I researched, tested, wrote, and performed a professional talk 
		during the Intern Colloquium. I presented on the LinkedIn breach, and how a malicious entity could 
	 	use that released data to cause havoc. In addition I was recognized for my presentation skills. I competed 
		and was accepted into the Speech Master Class (only 16 were admitted from a group of 100+). Separately, 
		I also lead my speech team to the finals of the speech competition, where we presented on Cyber Insurance. 
		At the end of my internship I recieved my evaluation, based on the feedback from my peers on my work 
		performance. I recieved a superb review (the highest possible), and was asked to stay on during the 
		school year as a co-op.</p>
